# Production Files
These files contain the isolated HTML and CSS for you to simply copy/paste into your production file, as well as a script file to just insert into your page. There are also minified version of the CSS and JavaScript in [/min/](./min/).

The images are currently  located at root/public/images/..., although you could adapt this for your layout.
